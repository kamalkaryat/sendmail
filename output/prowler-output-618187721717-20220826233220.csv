It is recommended and considered a standard security advice to grant least privilege—that is; granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Determine what users need to do and then craft policies for them that let the users perform only those tasks instead of allowing full administrative privileges. Providing full administrative privileges instead of restricting to the minimum set of permissions that the user is required to do exposes the resources to potentially unwanted actions.,It is more secure to start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary; rather than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later.
